# python-api-challenge

By: Itzel VÃ¡zquez SÃ¡nchez

## Project Description :page_facing_up:

This project is part of the Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp from TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey. In this assignment, the task was to manipulate Pandas DataFrames to practice Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals in order to answer this question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?".

ðŸ¤“ This Project is the result of the learning lessons of Module 6: Python APIs from the Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp 2024. The main goal is to use the acquired habilities and knowledge in a real case.

## How to Use the Project

### WeatherPy
The first deliverable should contain a series of plots and linear regressions of the following relationships:

* Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

It includes an explanation of the linear regressions after the plots.

### VacationPy
The second deliverable should contain:

* Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.

* Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:
  - A max temperature lower than 27 degrees but higher than 21
  - Wind speed less than 4.5 m/s
  - Zero cloudiness
* Create a new DataFrame called hotel_df to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity.
* For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.
* Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map as in the following image:
